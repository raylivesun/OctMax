Ddoc

For documentation on tuples that are commonly present in other languages (anonymous runtime entity that groups
different values) refer to $(LINK2 phobos/std_typecons.html#tuple, Phobos documentation on std.typecons.tuple)

You may be also looking for documentation for built-in $(LINK2 ctarguments.html, compile-time sequences)
which can be sometimes referred as "tuples" too (though it is discouraged).

Macros:
    TITLE=Tuples
        SUBNAV=$(SUBNAV_ARTICLES)
