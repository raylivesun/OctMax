/*
Source file for qualifier-combinations.svg and qualifier-combinations.eps. The
commands to run (assuming graphviz is installed) are:

cd /path/to/dlang.org/images
dot -Tsvg qualifier-combinations.dot >qualifier-combinations.svg
dot -Teps qualifier-combinations.dot >qualifier-combinations.eps

These commands are not part of the makefile because the files are fairly stable
and so as to not make the build depending on graphviz being installed.
